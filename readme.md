# My Practice with GitHub

This repository shows the progress and lessons I learned in using Git and GitHub.

## Lessons:
### Add Commits to a Repo. 
- In this lesson, I've learned how to add files to staging area, make commits, write descripitve commit messages, view the difference between commits, and create an ignore file.
### Tagging, Branching, and Merging. 
- In this lesson, I've learned how to tag a commit, create branches, and merging the branches to the master.
### Undoing Changes. 
- In this lesson, I've learned how to modify the last commit, revert a commit, and reset a commit.
### Working with Remotes. 
- In this lesson, I've learned how to add a remote repo, pull changes from the remote repo, fix merge conflicts, and push the local repo to the remote repo.

## Things I Learned on My Own
I have another GitHub account, GratitudeTree, which is for practice purposes. When I pushed my local repo to GitHub, I noticed all my local commits are under my other account name even though I supplied this account username and password. After fixing the global configuration on GitBash to change user.email to this account, it correctly shows this account as the author of the commits.
